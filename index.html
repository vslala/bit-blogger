<p>This project is based on the MVC Architecture, i.e, Model-View-Controller to provide a create separation of various modules which are used in the making of this project. MVC simplifies the development of this project by clearing defining the modules and their functionality. </p>

<p>Model - This module's sole responsibility is to manage all the database operation with their corresponding tables in the database. It performs all the CRUD (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) Operation which are to be performed in the database.</p>

<p>View - This module's sole responsibility is to provide the correct view to the user to interact with.</p>

<p>Controller - This module's sole responsibility is to fix the gap between Model and View. Controller basically acts as a mediator between the view and the model. If you want to read more about MVC Architecture, follow the below link,
