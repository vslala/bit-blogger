This was an attempt to create a framework which could be extended as per the user needs.

MVC simplifies the development of this project by clearing defining the modules and their functionality. \r\n\r\nModel - This module's sole responsibility is to manage all the database operation with their corresponding tables in the database. It performs all the CRUD (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) Operation which are to be performed in the database.\r\n\r\nView - This module's sole responsibility is to provide the correct view to the user to interact with.\r\n\r\nController - This module's sole responsibility is to fix the gap between Model and View. Controller basically acts as a mediator between the view and the model. If you want to read more about MVC Architecture, follow the below link,\r\n[MVC Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)\r\n\r\n### Documentation \r\nWill be provided soon...\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
